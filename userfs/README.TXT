Welcome to UserFS Test Filesystem
==================================

This is a test filesystem for kernel development.
It contains various files and directories to test VFS functionality.

Directory structure:
- /bin         : System binaries (your compiled executables)
- /usr/bin     : User binaries
- /usr/lib     : Libraries  
- /etc         : Configuration files
- /home        : User home directories
- /tmp         : Temporary files
- /var/log     : Log files

You can compile executables and place them in bin/ or usr/bin/
Test your VFS implementation with these files!
